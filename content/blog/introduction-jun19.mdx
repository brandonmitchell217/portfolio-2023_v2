# A brief introduction

If you haven't visited my portfolio yet, hey! I'm Brandon Mitchell, a frontend developer based in the Raleigh, NC area. I've been working in web development for about five years, with much of that time focused on building with HubSpot CMS for marketing and product teams. Think landing pages, forms, email templates, and a whole lotta HubL.
Currently, I'm a developer at [Mole Street](https://www.molestreet.com/), a HubSpot partner agency where I get to collaborate with a small but dedicated team of talented folks. Together, we build creative solutions for a wide range of clients.
Outside of my full-time role, I stay pretty busy. I have a part-time dev job, I'm earning my software engineering degree through Western Governors University (WGU), and I'm a husband and father to two awesome kids. It's the busiest I've ever been, but it's all part of building a future I'm excited about.
When I do find a little free time, you'll probably find me tinkering with new tools or framework, or occasionally spending waaayy too much time trying to find the right font for a design. (Seriously, it can take days…)
In my past, I have worked on game development with a particular interest in 3D modeling & environments. While I will always be a fan of video games, I have found more of my home with web development. I'd eventually love to tinker more with UI & app development, but I would also love to dive into data analysis & Java. As you can see, there just isn't enough time in the day.

## Random things
- Something I'm currently interested in learning more about using [Rive](https://rive.app)
- I've been enjoying Severance & Dexter: New Blood as far as TV lately
- I also have watched a lot of Grey's Anatomy & Survivor. I know more than you'd expect from someone who isn't a fan. Married people might understand this one.
- My wife has recently discovered her love for ramen & pho. I now eat this quite often
- I'm trying to get better at Fortnite. I'm decent in Zero-Build, but my building skills leave something to be desired.

<a href="#my-start" data-id-link="true" aria-hidden="true"></a>
## My start
I really got my start with frontend development in 2019 when a friend of mine was looking to create a website for his music. I felt a bit overconfident and had told him I could do something like that despite not having done any kind of web development since my high school days of using Dreamweaver. I assumed I'd be able to just pick up something like Webflow or Wordpress & put something together in a few weeks. I was obviously very mistaken…

After about a week of fumbling with Webflow to make something absolutely horrendous, It seemed like I'd spend just as much time trying to make something halfway decent in Webflow as I would just learning to actually code. I had experience with HTML & CSS in the past with MySpace having played a huge part. I used to spend a lot of time making layouts. While I would consider myself to be a self-taught dev, we live in a time where I was able to benefit from the countless tutorial/how-to videos others have shared. [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), Brad Traversy([Traversy Media](https://www.traversymedia.com/)) and numerous others, are a big reason I am where I am today with my career. These creators made approaching the idea feasible for me by providing small, easy-to-digest steps for learning web dev topics. 

I will try to write a more detailed post that talks about my start in the industry. Something maybe including the learning process, my interviews before finally landing a job, and what it's been like trying to step out of that junior level I've considered myself at since starting. For now though, I want to keep it brief & save some content for other blog posts!

### About my blog

Can't say that I've tried blogging since the days of Xanga though. That has apparently been around 20 years(I just looked it up) so I'm also gonna take a few minutes to see if I qualify for AARP. 


I would not consider myself to be much of a writer. No judgments here, please!

I plan to write mostly about coding-related things such as HTML, CSS & JavaScript frameworks, accessibility, SEO & whatever else I find myself playing around with. I may occasionally include personal experiences & other random topics as they come up.
I would like to try tailoring content more for inexperienced devs, perhaps even ones eventually hoping to enter the field. I come from never even having known anyone in such a career. My history is filled with food, dish pits, and in general, embracing the suck. I find myself incredibly grateful for the work I get to do these days; getting to solve problems with sometimes creative methods while also creating a better life for my family. I would be working 50+ hour weeks anywhere from the hours of 2pm-2am Monday through Sunday. Most certainly working every Friday & Saturday night. The time I've gotten to spend with my kids during their early years is invaluable, and it's hard to find the words to fully express what being a dev has done for me.

### Outro

I'd say not too shabby for my first actual blog post. I'll definitely try to improve as I go. 

Thanks for stopping by if you've stuck around until the end, and I hope to have the chance to share more about myself & my experiences with you!
